Flaws in Property Project

1. 
user old device specific token remains in mongo collection if not logged out and jwt expires

2.
	No Email verificatuion while creating new account

	Can be solved : 
	As done in Forgot Password OTP verification (not a big deal)

3.
	Access Token is being used untill expired even after logout

	Can be solved : 
	using separate database for tokens, which keep track of active-live tokens,
	and during token invalidation, simply remove token from the database.


4.
Complete project is synchronous (blocking) because of spring-web.
	Spring-Web (Tomcat server) use 1 thread for 1 request :: 
		Which mean that thread will be blocked until the request gets completed.
		If thread-pool is having 100 threads, then it can only handle 100 concurrent request only,
			beyond 100 request, either the request will be delayed of the request get rejected.

	Can be solved : 
	use Spring-Webflux (Netty server) uses Event-loop model :: 
		Some threads are dedicated to intercept incoming request, some are dedciated to work in background and get data from Database.
